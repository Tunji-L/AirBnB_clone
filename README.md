![HBnB Logo](./images/AirBNBlogo.png)

## Description :page_facing_up:
The goal of the project is to deploy on the server a simple copy of the  [AirBnB website](https://www.airbnb.com/ "AirBnB website").

All the features were not implemented in this project but only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

The complete web application will compose;
-   A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
-   A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
-   A database or files that store data (data = objects)
-   An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

## Final Product :sunrise:
